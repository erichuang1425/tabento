**A local-first new tab workspace for saved tabs, notes, todos, reminders, and small trackers.**

TabNest replaces the Chromium new tab page. It helps you save tabs, group them with notes and todos, search them later, and reopen pages without keeping every tab loaded. Data stays in `chrome.storage.local`; the extension has no account system, no server, no host permissions, and no page-content reading.

## Why TabNest

Browser work is rarely just tabs. A session can include research links, half-written plans, reminders, reference pages, recurring routines, and things you want to reopen later without keeping them alive forever.

TabNest keeps that context in the new tab page:

- Save the current tab, every tab in a window, bookmarks, links, selections, or images.
- Organize saved context into workspaces, categories, groups, stacks, colors, and views.
- Mix tabs with notes, todos, reminders, and personal trackers without leaving the new tab page.
- Search by words, quoted phrases, color, item type, domain, URL, location, todo state, and reminders.
- Reopen saved pages directly or through a hibernated placeholder so the browser stays lighter.

## Features

| Area | What you can do |
| --- | --- |
| Workspaces | Create multiple workspaces, bind them to browser windows, switch categories, focus a group, archive context, and undo or redo changes. |
| Saved items | Store tabs, notes, todos, stacks inside stacks, color labels, reminders, and selected batches of cards. |
| Views | Move between board, list, focused group, and free-positioned canvas layouts depending on the kind of work. |
| Search | Combine text search with `type:`, `color:`, `domain:`, `site:`, `url:`, `in:`, `is:`, `has:reminder`, and `reminder:` operators. Prefix terms with `-` to exclude matches. |
| Hibernation | Open saved tabs through `suspended.html` and load the destination only when you activate it. |
| Popup | Save the current tab, save every open tab, and inspect open tabs from the extension action. |
| Tools | Use built-in Pomodoro, finance diary, subscriptions, habits, hydration, reading, goals, and workout trackers. |
| Portability | Export and import data with a versioned envelope and preview step before restore. |
| Privacy | Keep data in `chrome.storage.local`; TabNest requests no host permissions and does not read page content. |

Example search:

```text
type:tab in:work domain:github.com "pull request" -is:done
```

## Screenshots

Screenshots still need to be captured. The table below lists the views that should be added to the README and browser-store listing.

| Workspace board | Focus and search | Popup capture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Board, categories, groups, and nested stacks. | Operators, archive visibility, and focused group flow. | Current-tab and all-tabs save workflow. |

## Tech stack

- **Platform:** Chromium extension, Manifest V3
- **Languages:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Storage:** `chrome.storage.local`
- **Background runtime:** MV3 service worker
- **Browser APIs:** tabs, storage, context menus, bookmarks, alarms, notifications
- **Build tooling:** none required
- **CI:** GitHub Actions syntax and manifest validation

## Install

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions/` or `edge://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Choose **Load unpacked**.
5. Select the repository folder.
6. Open a new tab to launch TabNest.

After editing extension files, reload TabNest from the browser extensions page.

## Usage

- Open a new tab to use the main workspace.
- Use the extension popup to save the current tab or all open tabs.
- Right-click supported browser content to save pages, links, selections, and images.
- Use groups and stacks to shape a workspace around projects, reading queues, planning areas, or recurring routines.
- Use search operators when plain text is not enough:

```text
color:red,blue type:todo -is:done
site:github.com url:/issues in:research
has:reminder reminder:overdue
```

## Project structure

```text
tabnest/
|-- manifest.json        # MV3 manifest, permissions, commands, icons
|-- background.js        # Service worker for menus, alarms, notifications, saves
|-- newtab.html          # Main workspace shell
|-- newtab.css           # Themes, layout, components, tools, responsive styling
|-- newtab.js            # App state, rendering, search, import/export, tools

```

## Development

TabNest has no package install and no build command.

Run the validation checks used by CI:

```powershell
node --check newtab.js
node --check background.js
node --check popup.js
node --check suspended.js
node --check emoji-data.js
node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('manifest.json','utf8'))"
node -e "const m = JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('manifest.json','utf8')); if (m.manifest_version !== 3) throw new Error('manifest_version must be 3')"
```

Manual validation checklist:

- Load the unpacked extension in Chrome or Edge.
- Open a new tab and confirm the workspace renders.
- Save the current tab and all open tabs from the popup.
- Create a note, todo, group, stack, reminder, and archived item.
- Try board, list, focus, and canvas views.
- Verify search operators and negative filters.
- Export data, import it into a clean profile, and review the preview step before restore.

## Deployment

For local testing, load the repository folder as an unpacked extension.

For a packaged release:

1. Run the validation checks.
2. Confirm `manifest.json` has the intended version.
3. Zip the extension source files, excluding `.git` and local-only files.
4. Attach the zip to the GitHub release or submit it through the browser extension store workflow.

The current product release is documented in [RELEASE_NOTES.md](./RELEASE_NOTES.md).

## Privacy

TabNest keeps data local:

- Stored URLs, titles, notes, todos, reminders, workspace state, and tool data live in `chrome.storage.local`.
- The extension does not request host permissions.
- The extension does not read page content.
- Browser permissions are limited to tab workflows, storage, context menus, bookmarks import, alarms, and notifications.

| Permission | Why it is used |
| --- | --- |
| `tabs` | Save, reopen, focus, and close tabs for workspace flows. |
| `storage` | Persist local workspace and tool data. |
| `contextMenus` | Save pages, links, selections, and images from the browser context menu. |
| `bookmarks` | Import bookmarks into workspaces. |
| `alarms` | Schedule reminders and subscription alerts. |
| `notifications` | Show reminder and storage notifications. |

## Roadmap

- Add polished product screenshots for the README and browser-store listing.
- Add UI smoke tests for critical save, search, move, and restore flows.
- Expand migration coverage for import/export.
- Improve keyboard workflows, accessibility, and high-contrast support.
- Explore optional encrypted sync while preserving local-first defaults.

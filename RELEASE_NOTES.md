# Release Notes

## v3.1.0

- Introduced the official Folio app mark: stacked gradient pages in blue, violet, and
  soft folded-paper highlights.
- Added a Folio-first visual system while keeping the existing app themes, including light,
  dark, Rice Paper, Lacquer, Aurora, Dracula, Nord, Rose Pine, Tokyo Night, Solarized,
  Gruvbox, Catppuccin, Sepia, and Mono palettes.
- Updated the extension popup header to use the official SVG mark instead of the older inline
  monochrome symbol.

- Renamed the product to Folio. Existing local data and exports are preserved: storage keys
  are unchanged and old `stow`, `tabento`, `tabnest`, and `tabextend` exports still import.
- New default Folio theme: a soft blue/violet signature palette. Folio Dark and the prior
  themes (Rice Paper, Lacquer, Aurora, Dark, Light, and the rest) stay available.
- Board columns restyled as bento "compartments": framed cells with a gradient top accent and a
  faint sheen. Seed categories renamed from Quicklinks/Read later to Pinned/Later.
